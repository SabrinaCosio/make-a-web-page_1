<h1>The five most important things to take from this lesson:</h1>

<b>What a Web Page is</b>
<p>A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. 
Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.</p>

<b>How Coding Works</b>
<p>Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand.
The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote. </p>

  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340"> This
  video</a> gives a good overview.
</p>

<b>Computers are Stupid</b>
<p>Programmers need to write <em>exactly</em> the way a computer understands 
(also known as writing with correct "syntax"). 

<b>Programmers Can't Remember Everything</b>
<p>There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. 
If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up. 
</p>

<b>Basic HTML Vocabulary</b>
<p>You will be using HTML in the next few lessons, so it will be helpful if 
you're comfortable with the jargon
</p><b>-Tag:</b> An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have 
an opening tag and a closing tag,. 
Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag.
<br><b>-Element:</b> An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
<br><b>-Attribute:</b>	 This is a property of an HTML element.
